This repo is for the development of an Internet-Draft related to deploying
new cryptographic algorithms within DNSSEC.  The latest submitted version

This Internet-Draft is built using the `mmark` tool created by Miek Giebben and the Docker container created by Paul E. Jones to make using `mmark` and `xml2rfc` much easier.

If you have Paul Jones `rfctools` Docker container installed all you should have to do is type:

`make`

and both the necessary XML and TXT files will be generated.

Paul's Docker image can be found at:
