<abstract>
<t>As new cryptographic algorithms are developed for use in DNSSEC
signing and validation, this document captures the steps needed
for new algorithms to be deployed and enter general usage. The
intent is to ensure a common understanding of the typical deployment
process and potentially identify opportunities for improvement of
operations.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), broadly defined in {{?RFC4033}},
 {{?RFC4034}} and {{?RFC4035}}, make use of cryptographic algorithms
in both the signing of DNS records and the validation of DNSSEC
signatures by recursive resolvers.
</t>
<t>The current list of cryptographic algorithms can be found in the IANA
&quot;Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers&quot; registry
located at <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/"/>
Algorithms are added to this IANA registry through a process defined
in {{?RFC6014}}.  Note that {{?RFC6944}} provides some guidance as
to which of these algorithms should be implemented and supported.
</t>
<t>Historically DNSSEC signatures have primarily used cryptographic
algorithms based on RSA keys. As deployment of DNSSEC has
increased there has been interest in using newer and more secure
algorithms, particularly those using elliptic curve cryptography.
<vspace/>
The ECDSA algorithm {{?RFC6605}} has seen some adoption and two
new algorithms are being proposed: Ed25519
 and Ed448
.
</t>
<t>The challenge is that the deployment of a new cryptographic
algorithm for DNSSEC is not a simple process. DNSSEC algorithms
are used throughout the DNS infrastructure for tasks such as:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Generation of keys (<spanx style="verb">DNSKEY</spanx> record) for signing</t>
<t>Creation of DNSSEC signatures in zone files (<spanx style="verb">RRSIG</spanx>)</t>
<t>Usage in a Delegation Signer (<spanx style="verb">DS</spanx>) record {{?RFC3658}} for the
&quot;chain of trust&quot; connecting back to the root of DNS</t>
<t>Generation of NSEC/NSEC3 responses by authoritative DNS servers</t>
<t>Validation of DNSSEC signatures by DNS resolvers</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>In order for a new cryptographic algorithm to be fully deployed,
all aspects of the DNS infrastructure that interact with DNSSEC
must be updated to use the new algorithm.
</t>
<t>This document outlines the current understanding of the components
of the DNS infrastructure that need to be updated to deploy a new
cryptographic algorithm.
</t>
<t>It should be noted that DNSSEC is not alone in complexity of
deployment.  The IAB documented &quot;Guidelines for Cryptographic
Algorithm Agility&quot; in {{?RFC7696}} to highlight the importance
of this issue.
</t>

<section anchor="aspects-of-deploying-new-algorithms" title="Aspects of Deploying New Algorithms">
<t>For a new cryptographic algorithm to be deployed in DNSSEC, the
following aspects of the DNS infrastructure must be updated:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>DNS resolvers performing validation</t>
<t>Authoritative DNS servers</t>
<t>Signing software</t>
<t>Registries</t>
<t>Registrars</t>
<t>DNS Hosting Operators</t>
<t>Applications</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Each of these aspects is discussed in more detail below.
</t>

<section anchor="dns-resolvers-performing-validation" title="DNS Resolvers Performing Validation">
<t>DNS recursive resolvers perform &quot;validation&quot; to check the
DNSSEC signatures of records received in a DNS query.  To
validate the signatures, the resolvers need to be able to
understand the algorithm used to create the signatures.
</t>
<t>In the case of a new algorithm, the resolver software needs
to be updated.  In some cases this could require waiting
until an underlying library is updated to support the new
algorithm.
</t>
<t>Once the software is updated, the updates need to be deployed
to all resolvers using that software.  This can be challenging
in cases of customer-premises equipment (CPE) that does not
have any mechanism for automatic updating.
</t>

<section anchor="resolvers-and-unknown-algorithms" title="Resolvers and Unknown Algorithms">
<t>It should be noted that section 5.2 of {{?RFC4035}} states:
</t>
<t>“If the resolver does not support any of the algorithms listed
in an authenticated DS RRset, then the resolver will not be
able to verify the authentication path to the child zone.
In this case, the resolver SHOULD treat the child zone as
if it were unsigned.”
</t>
<t>This means that signing a zone with a new algorithm that is
not widely supported by DNS resolvers would result in the
signatures being ignored and the zone treated as unsigned
until resolvers were updated to recognize the new algorithm.
</t>
<t>Note that in at least one 2016 case the resolver software
deployed on customer premises by an Internet service provider (ISP)
turned out not to be compliant with RFC 4035. Instead of ignoring
the signatures using unknown algorithms and treating the zones
as unsigned, the validating resolver rejected
the signatures and returned a SERVFAIL to the DNS query. This
resulted in the ISP turning off DNSSEC validation on the equipment.
Further investigation showed that a newer version of the resolver
software did correctly support ECDSA, but now all customer premises
equipment must be updated to this new version.
</t>
<t>The point is that it is not safe to assume all resolver software
will correctly implement this part of RFC 4035.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="authoritative-dns-servers" title="Authoritative DNS Servers">
<t>Authoritative DNS servers serve out signed DNS records.  Serving new
DNSSEC signing algorithms should not be a problem as a well-written
authoritative DNS server implementation should be agnostic to the RR
DATA they serve.
</t>
<t>The one exception is if the new cryptographic algorithms are used in
the creation of NSEC/NSEC3 responses.  In the case of new NSEC/NSEC3
algorithms, the authoritative DNS server software would need to be
updated to be able to use the new algorithms.
</t>
<t>Note that some authoritative server implementations could include
DNSSEC signing as part of the server and thus also fall into the
&quot;Signing Software&quot; category below.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="signing-software" title="Signing Software">
<t>The software performing the signing of the records needs to
be updated with the new cryptographic algorithm.
</t>
<t>User interfaces that allow users to interact with the
DNSSEC signing software may also need to be updated to
reflect the existence of the new algorithm.
</t>
<t>Note that the key and signatures with the new algorithm will
need to co-exist with the existing key and signatures for
some period of time. This will have an impact on the size
of the DNS records.
</t>
<t>[NOTE(OS): Shouldn't we just update the language that requires the
resolver to be so strict and finally be done with this requirement?
Or just give a recommendation in the paragraph on resolver here?]
</t>
<t>One issue that has been identified is that not all commonly-used
signing software releases include support for an algorithm
rollover. This software would need to be updated to support
rolling an algorithm before any new algorithms could be deployed.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="registries" title="Registries">
<t>The registry for a top-level domain (TLD) needs to accept
DS records using the new cryptographic algorithm.
</t>
<t>Observations to date have shown that some registries only
accept DS records with certain algorithms.  Registry
representatives have indicated that they verify the accuracy
of DS records to reduce technical support incidents and ensure
customers do not mistakenly create any outages.
</t>
<t>However, this means that registries who perform this level
of checking must be able to understand new algorithms in
order to successfully verify the DS records.
</t>
<t>Separately, feedback from registrars has indicated that they
do not currently have any mechanism to understand what
DNSSEC algorithms a registry can accept.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="registrars" title="Registrars">
<t>Registrars perform a critical role in the DNSSEC &quot;chain of trust&quot;
of passing the DS record up to the Registry to ensure that
the signed zone can be authenticated from the root of DNS all
the way to the zone.
</t>
<t>If the registrar is also providing the DNS hosting services
for a domain, the registrar can easily create the <spanx style="verb">DS</spanx> record
from the <spanx style="verb">DNSKEY</spanx> record and pass the DS record up to the
registry.
</t>
<t>However, if the authoritative servers for a domain are not
with the registrar, then the registrar needs to provide
some mechanism to accept a DS record to pass that up to the
registry.  Typically this is done through a web interface.
</t>
<t>An issue is that many registrar web interfaces only allow
the input of DS records using a listed set of DNSSEC
algorithms.  Any new cryptographic algorithms need to be
added to the web interface in order to be accepted into
the registrar's system.
</t>
<t>Additionally, in a manner similar to registries, many
registrars perform some level of verification on the DS
record to ensure it was entered &quot;correctly&quot;.  To do this
verification, the registrar's software needs to understand
the algorithm used in the DS record.  This requires the
software to be updated to support the new algorithm.
</t>
<t>Note that work is currently underway in {{?I-D.ietf-dnsop-maintain-ds}}
to provide an automated mechanism to update the DS records
with a registry.  If this method becomes widely adopted,
registrar web interfaces may no longer be needed.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dns-hosting-operators" title="DNS Hosting Operators">
<t>DNS hosting operators are entities that are operating the
authoritative DNS servers for domains and with DNSSEC
are also providing the signing of zones.  In many cases they may
also be the registrar for domain names, but in other cases they
are a separate entity providing DNS services to customers.
</t>
<t>DNS hosting operators need to update their authoritative
DNS server software to understand new cryptographic algorithms,
but they also need to update their web interfaces and provisioning
software to allow configuration and support of new algorithms.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="applications" title="Applications">
<t>Beyond the recursive resolvers, authoritative servers, web
interfaces and provisioning software, it has been observed that
some applications (or &quot;apps&quot;), particularly in the mobile
environment, are including their own DNS resolvers within the
app itself.   These recursive resolvers are used by the app
instead of the recursive resolver included with the underlying
operating system.  These applications that perform DNSSEC
validation would need to also be updated to understand a
new algorithm.
</t>
<t>In many cases, it may be that an underlying developer library
needs to be updated first. It will then depend upon how long
it takes the application developer to pull in the updated
library.
</t>
<t>Outside of applications, these developer libraries are also
typically used by recursive resolver software and signing software.
</t>

<section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">
<t>This document provides a view into the steps necessary for the
deployment of new cryptographic algorithms in DNSSEC at the time
of this publication.  In order to more rapidly roll out new
DNSSEC algorithms, these steps must be understood and hopefully
improved over time.
</t>
<t>It should be noted that a common theme to emerge from all discussions
is a general reluctance to update or change any DNS-related
software.  &quot;If it isn't broken, don't fix it&quot; is a common refrain.
While perhaps understandable from a stability point of view,
this attitude creates a challenge for deploying new algorithms.
</t>
<t>One potential idea suggested during discussions was for some kind
of web-based testing tool that could assist people in understanding
what algorithms are supported by different servers and sites.
</t>
<t>It is also quite clear that any deployment of new algorithms for
DNSSEC use will take a few years to propagate throughout the
infrastructure.  This needs to be factored in as new algorithms
are proposed.
